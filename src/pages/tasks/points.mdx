Quick Lowery Offices FC wants to work on their plays by looking at their recent wins, losses and draws.

You must write a program that can:
- [ ] Calculate the number of points the team has
- [ ] Take an input for the number of wins, losses and draws

> A win is worth 3 points, a draw is worth 1 and a loss is worth -1

<CodeBlock client:load>
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int wins, losses, draws;
    int total_points;

    // Take input for the number of wins, losses, and draws
    printf("Enter the number of wins: ");
    scanf("%d", &wins);

    printf("Enter the number of losses: ");
    scanf("%d", &losses);

    printf("Enter the number of draws: ");
    scanf("%d", &draws);

    // Calculate the total points
    total_points = (wins * 3) + (draws * 1) - (losses * 1);

    // Print the total points
    printf("Total points: %d\n", total_points);

    return 0;
}

```
</CodeBlock>

## Stretch Task 1

Upgrade the program to allow the user to enter a running total.

The program should:
- [ ] Take W as a win
- [ ] Take L as a loss
- [ ] Take D as a draw
- [ ] Continue accepting input until X is entered
- [ ] These should also work for lowercase inputs

<CodeBlock client:load>
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char input;
    int total_points = 0;

    printf("Enter match results (W for win, L for loss, D for draw, X to exit): \n");

    while (1) {
        scanf(" %c", &input);  // Note the space before %c to consume any trailing newline character

        if (input == 'X' || input == 'x') {
            break;
        }

        switch (input) {
            case 'W':
            case 'w':
                total_points += 3;
                break;
            case 'L':
            case 'l':
                total_points -= 1;
                break;
            case 'D':
            case 'd':
                total_points += 1;
                break;
            default:
                printf("Invalid input. Please enter W, L, D, or X to exit.\n");
                break;
        }

        printf("Current total points: %d\n", total_points);
    }

    printf("Final total points: %d\n", total_points);
    return 0;
}
```
