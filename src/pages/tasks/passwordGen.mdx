Quick Lowery Offices has had some issues with hacking recently, people are breaking into the companies system through employees having bad passwords.
You must develop a program to generate new passwords for the users.

> e.g. Thomas Lower was born on 22/10/2004, his favourite colour is indigo, his shoe size is 10 and he lives in Maidstone.


The program must take from the user:
- [ ] Their full name
- [ ] Their date of birth
- [ ] Their favourite colour
- [ ] Their shoe size
- [ ] Where they live

And the password must be developed using:
- [ ] The first letter of their first name
- [ ] The second letter of their surname
- [ ] The last 2 digits of their birth year
- [ ] The second and third letters of their favourite colour
- [ ] The first three letters of their street name
- [ ] Their shoe size
- [ ] The letters C++

> Thomas' Password will be To04ndMai10C++

int main() {
    char fullName[100];
    char dateOfBirth[20];
    char favouriteColor[20];
    float shoeSize;
    char location[100];
    
    // Taking input from the user
    printf("Enter your full name: ");
    fgets(fullName, sizeof(fullName), stdin);
    fullName[strcspn(fullName, "\n")] = '\0'; // Remove newline character
    
    printf("Enter your date of birth (DD/MM/YYYY): ");
    scanf("%s", dateOfBirth);
    
    printf("Enter your favourite colour: ");
    scanf("%s", favouriteColor);
    
    printf("Enter your shoe size: ");
    scanf("%f", &shoeSize);
    
    printf("Enter where you live: ");
    scanf("%s", location);

    // Generating password
    char password[20];
    sprintf(password, "%c%c%02d%c%c%c%.2f%s", fullName[0], fullName[strlen(fullName)-2], 
            ((dateOfBirth[strlen(dateOfBirth)-2] - '0') * 10) + (dateOfBirth[strlen(dateOfBirth)-1] - '0'),
            favouriteColor[1], favouriteColor[2], location[0], shoeSize, "C++");

    // Outputting the password
    printf("Your password is: %s\n", password);

    return 0;
